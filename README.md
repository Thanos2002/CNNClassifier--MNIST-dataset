# CNN Classifier - MNIST dataset

This repository contains a simple and easy-to-implement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for digit classification, utilizing the MNIST dataset. The model architecture consists of two convolutional layers, followed by a fully connected hidden layer, and concludes with a final output layer. The implementation is user-friendly, making it easy to follow and modify, ideal for those new to CNNs and deep learning.

- **It is entirely implemented with Google Colab**, making it easy to run and experiment with the model in the cloud.
- **PyTorch** is used for the implementaion 
- **Built for beginners**, designed to be beginner-friendly and a great starting point for learning about CNNs and deep learning.
